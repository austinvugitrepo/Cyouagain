Hello my name is Austin! I am currently thinking about learning C, Ive always wanted to master a programming language but I never had
the patience to sit down and learn, well today I am gonna commit to trying to learn a language and I got this idea from watching my
Gentoo Linux System compile and saw a bunch of C files and thought why not learn C? Also at the same time as a computer science student
I believe I should also learn a thing or 2 about git as well, so I'm hoping I can kill 2 birds with one stone!

Just finished up to derived types (so I should continue from derived types later) in chapter 2 of effective C. Been taking it slow but have been suprising consistent with my learning of C so far which is awesome! Very proud of myself fr fr. That being said I discussed this in my last git commit but I am thinking about doing a project to facilitate my learning because this book is becoming more of a reference guide then an outright teaching book which is fine, but that just means I need to do some experimenting on my own. Not a big deal but I am really bored with a lot of the project ideas I have been researching and hopefully I can find a project to do to develop my C skills, also been thinking about Rust lol, but better not try to collect languages cuz mastering one is better then mastering none.
Gonna finish this update for now in the README!

Read up to arrays, and will do examples for it. Will update entry if there are points not worth writing code.
update: finished the first example of arrays.
