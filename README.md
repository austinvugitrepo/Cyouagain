learning C and will update progress (hopefully)

7/26/25
Hello my name is Austin! I am currently thinking about learning C, Ive always wanted to master a programming language but I never had
the patience to sit down and learn, well today I am gonna commit to trying to learn a language and I got this idea from watching my
Gentoo Linux System compile and saw a bunch of C files and thought why not learn C? Also at the same time as a computer science student
I believe I should also learn a thing or 2 about git as well, so I'm hoping I can kill 2 birds with one stone!
